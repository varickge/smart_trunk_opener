\nEvent is a sequence of positive frames within a continuous time-series.\n\nBased on the difference between the ground truth and the prediction, events are given error scores.\n\nThe given error types are:\n\nInsertion: The app falsely predicts an event, when the ground truth states that there has not been an event.\nI' - The number of the events of the prediction corresponding to the insertion.\n\nDeletion: The app does not predict an event, when the ground truth states that the event has happened.\nD - The number of the events of the ground truth corresponding to the deletion.\n\nFragmenting: The event of the ground truth corresponds to several events in the prediction.\nF - The number of the events of the ground truth corresponding to the fragmentation.\nF' - The number of the events of the prediction corresponding to F.\n\nMerge: The event of the prediction corresponds to several events in the ground truth.\nM - The number of the events of the ground truth corresponding to merge.\nM' - The number of the events of the prediction corresponding to M.\n\nFM - The number of the events of the ground truth that are both F and M.\nFM' - The number of the events of the prediction that are both F' and M'.\n\nThe rest of the events that are not assigned to any of those error types are considered as correct (C).
